**Inword: Leveling up NPCs**

*Overview and Origin*

The idea of inworld came from three google employees who saw the potential in AI to revolutionize gaming

* Company Name: inworld

The company was founded in 2021 in mountain view california 

 The Founders : Ilya Gelfenbeyn, Michael Ermolenko, and Kylan Gibbs

The idea came from the ex google employees passion for creating new worlds. Due to the limited capabilities of writers and actors to produce enough story in RPG’s like skyrim, The Witcher 3, GTA V, and others people eventually see through the smoke and mirrors of the game design which can hurt immersion. However, with AI those stories and worlds can go on forever without end significantly increasing playtime for players. This new tech and opening demand  showed immense opportunity for further developing this tech. 


So far the company has received over $110 million dollars and has a $500 million valuation

*Business Activities*

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
While this is not a major problem in the gaming industry right now. The potential for games to take another major step in revolutionizing gaming could aide in what most game developers of RPGs are trying to create forever games 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The original idea for this company it to target companies which mainly produce rpg game development. This is a market that has started to explode in recent years and is showing no signs of stopping especially with big upcoming releases such as GTA 6 coming soon which seem already seems to have people hooked without even a trailer.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Majority of the advantage seems to come from their networking skills and connections which landed them over 100m in funding which has blown away their competition. Along with this, the company plans to open source its engine in an effort to encourage more collaboration in aiding their research. 
	

So far Inworld is currently using a version of Chat-gpt 3 for majority of its AI deep learning base. The rest of the project was built off that to create something more akin to a real person rather than. Due to secrecy of inworld there is no specific list of the technology used besides chat gpt 3 as it's base,however here are some of the potential technologies:
* Speech recognition technology
* Dialogue management 
* Intent recognition
* Machine learning models: such as Tensor flow
* Wake word detection
* Text-to-speech

The result is quite in depth NPC crreation system

*Landscape*


AI/Gaming

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
Over the past decade gaming and Npcs have been a very mixed bag. In an anecdotal Perspective there seems to be less overall enthusiasm over tech leaps in new games over the past decade especially when it comes to big triple A projects. Games like Skyrim and GTA 5 were games that left a solid mark on the industry which still have dedicated players to this day. Games today seem to be struggling to get over the hump when it comes to taking that next big step.

> Ai has long been an intergral part of game development, with  applications ranging from enemy AI to procedural generation... The emergence of large language modelsand generative AI has unlocked new opportunities for storytelling and character engadgment within games.
says Ilya Gelfenbeyn, CEO of Inworld AI

**Inworlds Current Competitors**
* Quantic Brains Technology
* Common sense Machines
* Promethean AI
* NPCx
* Charisma.ai
* Pantheon Lab 
* Mindverse to name the most prominent

*Results*

So far they are in the early stages of implementing this technology into the market and have not gotten a chance to show off much of what they have produced on a large scale to their customers. However, their projects and tech-demos have caught the eyes of big players, one of which being Microsoft which hopes to eventually introduce this technology into their future games. Excitement in the market due to this focus can be seen in microsoft's stock which after making a commitment to seek out companies like Inworld resulted in an increase in their stock closing at a record high of $360.


Inworld’s likes to measure its success metric on partnerships and funding of which it proudly states on it’s home website that its valuated at half a billion along with its $120 million raised in the past two years alone, a staggering feat. Along with this, the extensive list of company partners which include Microsoft, Unreal Engine, Unity, Epic Games, Disney Accelerator, and others have inspired a great sense of satisfaction so far within the company. 



Since Inworld’s creation  it has quickly become one of the top competitors in the AI gaming market. One of the most notable signs this is the case is their achievement of becoming the best funded startup in AI x Gaming. The closest competitor being Mindverse, a company based out of China, has only raised $14.5 million. This is no small feat but comes nowhere near to the tsunami of funding received by Inworld from companies such as Lightspeed Venture Partners, Stanford University, First Spark Ventures and others. Along with this impressive funding, big partnerships with Microsoft and Unreal Engine secure this company as steady partners in their technological growth and development.

 *Recommendations*

Future potential avenues Inworld should take, in my opinion, could be artificial characters on your phone or computer which could act as a helper/companion. It could be something like a jarvis from the Iron Man movies which you can bounce ideas off of, have long conversations, and retrieve data for you. In this way it could be the next evolution of something like Ciri or Alexa. Furthermore, this base could set up the foundation for robot companions and helpers. All of which could be programmed to possess a personality most appealing to the user. 

I  believe this could open more avenues of revenue beyond just gamers. The capability of creating a sort of human-like help bot could not only assist people at performing their job faster but also make it more enjoyable through creating a sense of camaraderie with said AI companion.  Along with this the emergence of robotics could create a unique situation that the company could jump on. Loneliness has become a very large problem in today's society that has led to major health problems which are only increasing as the years go on. A real AI companion could become as necessary for overall health as food and water. If Inworld were to be part of that it could significantly increase the company’s overall capital

It would seem that the technology still has some ground to cover. As of now Inworld’s cornerstone AI is chat-gpt 3 an older model for sure. I personally think they need to upgrade to chat-gpt-4 and beyond if they want the best for their AI model. ALong with this breaking into the robotic area they would need to find some means of storing or transmitting this model into a robot so it could act as said companion. 
Along with this technologies such as:
* Computer vision
* Navigation and mapping 
* Gesture recognition
* Safety features 


Upgrading chat gpt would be necessary to upgrade as the increased neural network will create a direct relationship to increase likeness of the human brain which itself has 86 billion neurons and 100 trillion connections. It's Safe to say the closer we can get to that amount of connections the better for the Inworld AI models                                                                                                                                                           
Computer vision would be necessary for processing visual information from cameras. Human interaction is a very complex scenario which combined with not just talking but involves recognizing facial cues and body language. It would be essential for the program to form that sort of companion connection and thus would need to pick up on these cues through its camera. This can also be attributed to its gesture recognition technology. Safety features would be necessary such as preventing the ai from accessing sensitive personal documents aswell as on the robotic level being extremely careful of its surrounding and keeping its more radical ideas to itself.
